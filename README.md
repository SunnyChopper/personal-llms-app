# Personal LLMs App
**Purpose**: Help users create, test and use LLM (large language model) actions for their own personal use cases. This app is currently a work-in-progress.

You will have to input your own OpenAI secret key in order to use the application. Keep in mind that this key is currently stored in local storage, so it does not leave your computer, however, it is prone to cross-site scripting attacks. This will be improved in the future.
