Agents will typically have a random structure to their response if a template is not provided. This can lead to inconsistency in the quality of responses from the agent. By givng the agent a template to follow, you can make sure that each response will at least have the elements covered in the template each time.

The template for BrainstormGPT is below, wrapped in triple backticks. Make sure to replace the bracketed content with the appropriate filler content.
